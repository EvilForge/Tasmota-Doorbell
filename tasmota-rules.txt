### This is a comment dont send it to tasmo.. 
### Turn off and clear rule1, then set it to send MQTT topics if the voltage level is above "pressed" levels,
### and publish OFF when its below. I watched the tasmo device page to see what analog went to when i pressed
### the doorbell, and subtraced some to give me a margin of error. 145 is my high (pressed) reading, 9 is the low,
### so 100 works well.  Consult Tasmota wiki for details on rules and using them.
